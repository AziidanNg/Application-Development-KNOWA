# KNOWA

> Empowering NGOs to Connect, Organise, and Grow

---

### 🚩 Project Status

This project is currently in the **pre-seed development phase**. We have a completed high-fidelity prototype (built in Figma) and are now building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### 💡 About The Project

Many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Malaysia struggle with disorganization. They often rely on a scattered mix of tools like WhatsApp, Facebook, Google Sheets, and manual forms to manage their operations, members, and events.

This leads to poor coordination, low member engagement, and inefficient event management, which ultimately reduces their community impact.

**KNOWA** solves this by providing a single, centralized, all-in-one mobile application designed specifically for the workflow of an NGO and its members.

### ✨ Core Features

Our solution is an integrated platform with 6 key features:

* **Event Management:** A platform for admins to create, share, and manage all organizational events.
* **Smart Calendar:** Allows admins to schedule meetings and lets members sync events to their personal calendars with automated reminders.
* **Communication Hub:** A built-in chat for official announcements, private staff channels, and file sharing, replacing scattered WhatsApp groups.
* **Donation Page:** A centralized and trusted way for the public to contribute financially to the NGO's initiatives.
* **Application Management:** A formal portal for admins to approve or reject new membership applications.
* **AI Chatbot:** Provides instant, 24/7 assistance to users by answering FAQs about events, membership, and donations.

### 💻 Technology Stack
